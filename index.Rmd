The objective of the research was to summarize, using a meta-analytic approach, the relationship between Fusarium head blight index and wheat yield using data obtained from independent studies. Then, a simulation approach was used to estimate yield losses due to FHB, using disease predictions by a disease model, over a 28-year time series covering the period before and after FHB resurge. Finally, the risk of not-offsetting on the financial investment on fungicide treatment (tebuconazole), applied once or twice, was calculated for a range of wheat prices and fungicide costs. Tebuconazole have been used to control FHB in wheat (caused by *Fusarium graminearum* species complex), and evaluated during 10 years and multiple sites in south Brazil.
